  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. Simple function call has 2 variations in strict mode this will return undefined everytime and in non strict mode it will return the window/ everything in the global object.(bad practice)
    2. In implicit binding this key word will point to the object  of the called function. You can tell by looking to the left of the period when the function is called.
    3. Explicit binding allows us to set this. to point/refernece a certain value with apply,call and bind or we can call a function with a specific value for this using apply and call.
    4. new Binding allows us to use the new keyword to create a new object and the this keyword will point to /reference it.
